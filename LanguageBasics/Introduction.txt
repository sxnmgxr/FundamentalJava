Variables
You've already learned that objects store their state in field. however, the java
programming language also uses the term "varibale" as well. this section discuess this relationship
, plus variable naming rules and conventions, basic data types (primitive types, character Strings and arrys)
, default values, and literals.

Operators
this section describes the Operators of the java programming language. it presents the most commonly-used
Operators first, and the less commonly-used Operators lasts. each discussion include code samples.
 
Expressions, statements, and blocks
Operators may be used in building Expressions, which compute values, Expressions are the core components of
statements, statements may be grouped into blocks.

Control Flow statements
this section describes the control flow statements supported by the java programming language. it covers the 
decisions-making, looping, and branching statements that enable your program to conditionally execute particular
block of code.
