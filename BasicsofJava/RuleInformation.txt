 ||Source File Name

The name of a source file should exactly match the public class name with 
the extension of .java. The name of the file can be a different name if it
 does not have any public class. Assume you have a public class GFG.

GFG.java // valid syntax
gfg.java // invalid syntax

||Case Sensitivity

Java is a case-sensitive language, which means that the identifiers AB, Ab, aB, 
and ab are different in Java.

System.out.println("GeeksforGeeks"); // valid syntax
system.out.println("GeeksforGeeks"); // invalid syntax because of the first letter 
of System keyword is always uppercase.

|| Class Names

i. The first letter of the class should be in Uppercase (lowercase is allowed but 
discouraged).

ii. If several words are used to form the name of the class, each inner word’s first
 letter should be in Uppercase. Underscores are allowed, but not recommended. Also allowed
  are numbers and currency symbols, although the latter are also discouraged because they are 
  used for a special purpose (for inner and anonymous classes).

class MyJavaProgram    // valid syntax
class 1Program         // invalid syntax
class My1Program       // valid syntax
class $Program         // valid syntax, but discouraged
class My$Program       // valid syntax, but discouraged (inner class Program inside the class My)
class myJavaProgram    // valid syntax, but discouraged


||5. public static void main(String [] args)

The method main() is the main entry point into a Java program; this is where the processing starts.
 Also allowed 
is the signature public static void main(String… args)

6. Method Names

i. All the method names should start with a lowercase letter 
(uppercase is also allowed but lowercase is recommended).

ii. If several words are used to form the name of the method,
 then each first letter of the inner word should be in Uppercase. 
 Underscores are allowed, but not recommended. Also allowed are digits
  and currency symbols.

public void employeeRecords() // valid syntax
public void EmployeeRecords() // valid syntax, but discouraged

||7. Identifiers in java

Identifiers are the names of local variables, instance and class variables, and labels,
 but also the names for classes, packages, modules and methods. All Unicode characters are
  valid, not just the ASCII subset. 

i. All identifiers can begin with a letter, a currency symbol or an underscore (_). 
According to the convention, a letter should be lower case for variables.

ii. The first character of identifiers can be followed by any combination of letters, 
digits, currency symbols and the underscore. 
The underscore is not recommended for the names of variables. Constants (static final attributes and enums) 
should be in all Uppercase letters.

iii. Most importantly identifiers are case-sensitive.

iv. A keyword cannot be used as an identifier since it is a reserved word and has some special meaning.
